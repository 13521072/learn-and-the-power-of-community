# The Learn Philosophy

# Welcome!!!!

Welcome to Learn! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of learners! Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, self-driven, and absolutely serious about learning to code. We are on a never ending quest for knowledge and we know there are no shortcuts.

## The Learn Curriculum

The curriculum on Learn is designed for beginners and tries to make no assumptions about previous experience. However, our curriculum is rigorous. Expect it to be a little more challenging than other online learning platforms. We don't dumb anything down because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn.

Learn will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful, and gritty. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you are already.

## Community on Learn

We don't believe in learning alone. Students learn the most when they learn together. Community and curriculum has always been Flatiron School's secret to success. Today, you are joining this movement.

We have built a social learning platform that truly empowers you to learn together.

  * When you are stuck on a lab, you can ask a question to the entire community and work through the problem with another student. 
  * When you are confused by a concept, you can host a study group to discuss with other students. 
  * When you need a break you can socialize in the communal chat lobby. 
  * As you meet people you can add them as friends, supporting them in their journey and never ever having to learn alone.

Finally, we expect everyone on Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special. Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone.
